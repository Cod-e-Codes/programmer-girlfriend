**Dear Crystal,**

Happy Birthday to my favorite **programmer girlfriend**—the one who debugged my heart and optimized my happiness algorithm! 🎉❤️

If my love for you were a loop, it would be `while (true)`, because it’s infinite and unstoppable. You’re the **root user** in my life, the one with full access to my love and all my secrets. (Don’t worry, I didn’t forget to add a firewall for everyone else.)

Every day with you feels like an upgraded version of life—like we’re running the latest patch that fixes all my bugs and improves my emotional UX. When you smile, it’s like a perfectly executed **print("LOVE YOU")** function, and when you laugh at my bad jokes, it’s proof that our compatibility is beyond **99.9% confidence level**. 

I know you're studying Data Analysis, so here’s a little insight for your birthday:
- Dataset: My Heart
- Variable: LoveForYou
- Status: OverflowError 😘

Today, I hope your **stack** of gifts and love overflows (no segfaults, I promise). You’re the only person I’d willingly share my **cookies** with, and that’s saying something. Testing my apps with you is the best form of pair programming I could ever ask for—it’s like you were written into my codebase by destiny.

So here’s my final line of code for today:  
```python
if girlfriend_birthday:
    celebrate_with_love()
```

Happy birthday to the most beautiful compiler of my joy, debugger of my bad days, and lifelong commit partner. I love you to the moon and back, and if you ask me to quantify it, I’ll say `float('inf')`. 🥰

Now go blow out those candles and make a wish! (But I’m already wishing for us to keep coding this amazing story together forever.)

With all my heart (and CPU cycles),  
Cody

P.S. You’re the only `girl` in my `friend` list who gets to call herself a **programmer girlfriend**—and that makes you truly **one-of-a-kind**.
